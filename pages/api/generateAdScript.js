    Write two variations of a Facebook ad caption using the following information:

    Avatar and Their Problem: ${avatar}
    Desired Outcome: ${desiredOutcome}
    Ineffective Method 1: ${ineffectiveMethod1}
    Ineffective Method 2: ${ineffectiveMethod2}
    Ineffective Method 3: ${ineffectiveMethod3}
    New Solution Name: ${newSolution}

    Please write each ad copy variation in this format:

    Variation 1:
    Line 1: ðŸ“ž CALLING ALL [AVATAR + THEIR PAIN]: [achieve your desired outcome] with this NEW METHOD...
    Line 2: I understand that you may have already tried:
    - [Ineffective Method 1]
    - [Ineffective Method 2]
    - Or even - [Ineffective Method 3]
    Line 3: But you're still seeing no progress towards [desired outcome].
    Line 4: That's why I want to introduce you to [new solution name].
    Line 5: As of 2024, it's the fastest and easiest way to [desired outcome].
    Line 6: If you're interested in learning moreâ€¦
    Line 7: You can access it right here: [INSERT LINK]

    Variation 2:
    [Create a different approach using the same information but with a unique angle or hook]

    Make sure both ad copy variations are engaging, persuasive, and tailored to the specific avatar and their problem. Use emojis where appropriate to make the ads more visually appealing.
